# Nodeclipse -- Node.js support for Eclipse


> [Nodeclipse](http://www.nodeclipse.org/) is [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin for the [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/). 
The purpose of Nodeclipse is to create an environment in 
which development of Node is easy for any user from beginner to intermediate user. 
Development is slow, but ongoing. If you would like to help out, 
please leave a comment stating so in the Nodeclipse forum.

## Vision
