# Nodeclipse -- Node.js support for Eclipse


> [Nodeclipse](http://www.nodeclipse.org/) is [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin for the [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/). 
The purpose of Nodeclipse is to create an environment in

Development is slow, but ongoing. If you would like to help out, 
please leave a comment stating so in the Nodeclipse forum.
